# Introduction
Welcome to watchlist generator! The application uses datasets 
provided by IMDb. The data is properly processed using Pandas 
to reduce the file weight as much as possible. The data is then 
loaded into the SQLite database. After the user completes the form, 
the sent data is used to dynamically create the appropriate statement, 
and then the statement is executed. In this way, a list of films 
generated based on appropriate filters is created, from which the number 
of films provided in the form is randomly selected.

# What's next?
Here is a short video showing how it works. As for now the app has not
been deployed, yet. However, it will probably be done soon.
