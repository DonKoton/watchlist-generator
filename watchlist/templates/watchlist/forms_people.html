    <h4>Reminder</h4>
    <p>Fields with a note (min) mean that you enter the minimum value from which the films will be
        filtered for the selected parameter. Rating, number of votes and number of videos are fields that you need
        to fill in, the rest is optional. Keep in mind that you have to be sure to enter person's year of birth
        (there are duplicates of people with the same names and surnames in the database, so the person
        you might want to filter by may not be the one you are looking for).</p>
